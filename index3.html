            <p class="q">Can you relate to a character?</p>
            <p class="a">Yes, I can relate to Farah. One time, I had a special toy to me and I lost it. Kind of how when Farah lost her brother.</p>
            <p class="q">Have you ever been in the same situation as one of the characters?</p>
            <p class="a">Yes I have. One time, I got stuck in a little hole at the trampoline park. I had to climb my way out of it. This is and example of how they got stuck in those holes and they had to use bones to get themselves out.</p>
            <p class="q">Have you ever visited the setting of this text?</p>
            <p class="a">I haven't been there exactly, but I've been somewhere that is kind of similar there. I went to a beach before which had lots of sand. In the Gauntlet, at the start of the game, they first get teleported into a sandy place.</p>
