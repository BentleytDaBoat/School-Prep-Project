            <p>This book is mainly about 4 people who get trapped in a board game. THe main character is named Farah. She is the one who has a brother, Ahmed, that gets trapped inside of a board game with her and her friends. There is also Essie and Alex who are Farahs best friend. It is Farah's 12th birthday party where her grandmother gifts her a board game. It is called, The Gauntlet.The book is filled with so many adventures and turns. I find the book very interesting because they get trapped in a board game.</p>
